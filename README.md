Mapkin
======
Easy-to-use cross-engine javascript map library

Mapping in javascript is hard. Google maps is the leader in JS map providers, but their javascript SDK is incredibly large, and very complex. While the actual SDK follows common javascript paradigms, the documentation does not, making it nearly unusable. Open Street Maps is the open competitor to Google in the mapping arena, but their JS API is not as robust as Google's and is a little bit hard to understand.

Mapkin will combine the two APIs under one easy-to-understand roof.

In order to do this, Mapkin will choose a few key features that are commonly used in JS maps, and focus on those. Certain features that are available within either Google Maps or Open Street Maps will not be available directly from Mapkin. However, Mapkin will expose the underlying map objects, so you can add advanced features outside of Mapkin.

Feature Goals
=============
- Markers (active, hover, inactive, bubbles)
- Zoom levels
- Geolocation
- Directions
